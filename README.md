# 2048 Game

This is a web-based implementation of the classic **2048** puzzle game, built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## How to Play

The objective of the game is to combine tiles with the same number to create a tile with the number 2048. The game is played on a 4x4 grid. Use the arrow keys to move the tiles. Every time you move, a new tile appears on the grid with the number 2 or 4. When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into one.

### Controls:
- **Arrow Keys**: Move the tiles.

## Features

- **Keyboard controls** for smooth gameplay.
- **Simple, clean UI** that mimics the original 2048 design.
- **Responsive layout** for various screen sizes.
- Automatic **game over** detection when no more valid moves are available.
